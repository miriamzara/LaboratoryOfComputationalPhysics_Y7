That is the case for several puroposes: file system managment, low level operations, advanced local and remote configurations, access and management of remote resources, etc. Several languages exists (all rather similar to each other), we will review BASH, a default **interpreter** on many GNU/Linux systems."

    "\n",
    "#### **Bash**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is a specific implementation of a **shell**, derived from the Bourne shell (`sh`) with additional features.\n",
    "- **Key Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - It is both a **command interpreter** (you type commands interactively) and a scripting language (you write commands in a script file and execute it).\n",
    "  - Bash is widely used as the default shell on many Linux distributions and macOS (before zsh became the default).\n",
    "  - Supports advanced features like:\n",
    "    - **Filename globbing** (e.g., `*.txt` matches all `.txt` files).\n",
    "    - **Piping** (e.g., `ls | grep \"pattern\"` to pass output from one command to another).\n",
    "    - **Control structures**: `if`, `for`, `while`, etc., for scripting.\n",
    "    - **Command substitution**: Embedding commands within commands (e.g., `$(date)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Think of Bash as**: A powerful tool for executing commands, automating tasks, and managing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Shell**\n",
    "- **Definition**: A shell is a **general term** for any command-line interface (CLI) that allows a user to interact with the operating system.\n",
    "- **Key Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - It's a **macro processor**, meaning it processes and interprets text commands into actions for the operating system.\n",
    "  - Can be interactive (you type commands and get responses immediately) or non-interactive (running pre-written scripts).\n",
    "  - Several different shell implementations exist, including:\n",
    "    - **Bourne shell (`sh`)**: The original Unix shell.\n",
    "    - **C shell (`csh`)**: Known for C-like syntax.\n",
    "    - **Z shell (`zsh`)**: Modern shell with many usability features.\n",
    "    - **Bash (`bash`)**: A popular descendant of `sh` with extended features.\n",
