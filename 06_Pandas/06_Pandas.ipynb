    "The `numpy` module is excellent for numerical computations, but to handle missing data or arrays with mixed types takes more work. The `pandas` module is currently the most widely used tool for data manipulation, providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and advanced data analysis tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular `pandas` features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A fast and efficient \"DataFrame\" object for data manipulation with integrated indexing;\n",
    "* Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, HDF5);\n",
    "* Intelligent data alignment and integrated handling of missing data;\n",
    "* Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets;\n",
    "* Aggregating or transforming data with a powerful **group-by** engine; \n",
    "* High performance merging and joining of data sets;\n",
    "* Hierarchical axis indexing provides an intuitive way of working with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure;\n",
    "* Time series-functionalities;\n",
    "* Highly optimized for performance, with critical code paths written in C-Python or C.\n"
